A charity game jam project for LD48 hosted by @McPunkypants.

I don't decide on the game name just yet.

-- Code Guideline --
1. Prefix variables/functions with "_" to indicate that it's private members.
2. Non-prefix variables/functions means public members.
3. All basic initilization of values will be done in init...() function, not to pay attention too much on the single line declaration.

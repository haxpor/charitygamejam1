CLD1

A game made for charity game jam project or MiniLD#38 as part of Ludumare event hosted by @McFunkypants.

Firstly, you can play this game at http://www.charitygamejam.com/?CLD1 or directly at my company website at http://basementdojo.com/.

I made this game with another artist and freelance sound maker, and be able to complete the whole project within 5 days. You know the event has no restriction on deadline, just make a game and submit. It serves the purpose.

Not every single bit of code is optimized so please use it for educational purpose and build up on that :)

I use cocos2d-html5-v.2.0.0 @ Aug.28, 2012. See it at http://cocos2d-x.org/projects/cocos2d-x/wiki/Download. Please note that I use both cocos2d-x and cocos2d-html5 from the day 1 of their own development process by the team making it. So that's legit story about it.

The project utilize the following features.
- Manual implementation of parallax objects
- Actions (notable are Sequence, DelayTime, MoveTo, MoveBy, and CallFunc)
- Making complex (sort of) animation to works
- schedule + scheduleUpdate
- LabelTTF with custom .ttf file
- Keyboard event
- Scrolling credits style
- Mainmenu selection in retro (or NES) style
- Manipulate vector for aiming, shooting, and placing bullets for guns
- Collision detection of bullets against zombies
- Simulate moving scene
- Zombie spawning system

-- Code Guideline --
1. Prefix variables/functions with "_" to indicate that it's private members.
2. Non-prefix variables/functions means public members.
3. All basic initilization of values will be done in init...() function, not to pay attention too much on the single line declaration within the class.

I'm open and accept all kind of comments or suggestion, or if you want to connect with me, just follow my twitter or send me e-mail.
